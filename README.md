# Chinese-Spirits-Bubble-Datasets

This is a dataset of Chinese spirits bubble, which are shot from actual Chinese spirits distillation process of a large brewery in Sichuan, China. 

Chinese spirits are distilled spirits with a long history, usually obtained through natural fermentation. Traditional solid-state fermentation and brewing mainly include the following steps: materials preparation, starter preparation, fermentation, distillation, aging, and blending. During the distillation process, due to the presence and content changes of ethyl caproate, ethyl butyrate, acetaldehyde and other substances, the quality of spirits also changes with the distillation time. Collecting distillates according to the quality of spirits is a key process in the production, which is directly related to the quality of spirits and production efficiency. The traditional quality classification of spirits is judged by experienced workers by observing the visual characteristics of bubbles in the distillate. There are obvious differences in the visual morphological characteristics of bubbles (such as area, density, color, size, etc.) when the distillate flows out at different stages. therefore，we make this dataset publicly available for researchers to develop visual bubble classification techniques.

In our datasets, the whole distillation process is divided into five stages from I to V, namely the initial distillate (stage I), the second distillate (stage II), the third distillate (stage III), the last distillate (stage IV), and the tail water (stage V). As the distillation time increases, the alcohol by volume (ABV) decreases, and the flavor gradually deteriorates, which means that the quality of spirits decreases. The overall and partial details of distillate bubbles in different distillation stages are shown below.
